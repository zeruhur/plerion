# Rules Summary

## ACTIONS  
On their turn, a character may move up to 40ft and take up to one action. Actions may include casting a spell, attacking, making a second move, or other reasonable activities. Actions, attacks, and movements take place simultaneously. Whenever turn order is uncertain, the PCs should make a DEX save to see if they go before their enemies.

**Retreating** from a dangerous situation always requires a successful DEX save, as well as a safe destination to run to.

## ABILITIES  
**STR:** Brawn, prowess & resistance.   
**DEX:** Dodging, sneaking & reflexes.
**WIL:**  Persuasion, intimidation & psionics.

## SAVES  
- Roll a d20 equal to or under an ability.
- 1 is always a success, 20 is always a failure.

## HIT PROTECTION  
**HP** indicates a PC's ability to avoid getting hurt. It is lost during combat & recovered after a few moment's rest.

## INVENTORY  
PCs have 10 inventory slots: four on their body and six in their backpack (which acts as a sleeping bag if emptied). Most items take up a one slot, but smaller items can be bundled. **Bulky** items take up two slots and are awkward or difficult to carry.

Filling all ten item slots reduces a PC to 0 HP. PCs cannot carry more than their inventory allows, though carts & horses may provide an increase in slots.

## DEPRIVATION  
**Deprived** PCs cannot recover HP. If deprived for more than a day,they add a **Fatigue** to inventory. Fatigue occupies one slot and lasts until they can recover in safety. This effect is cumulative.

## HEALING  
A moment's rest and a swig of water will restore lost HP, but may leave the party vulnerable. **Ability** loss requires a week's rest and the aid of a skilled healer.

## CYBERNETICS
Cybernetics are expensive body augmentations that increase power and capabilities. Deterioration and hacking need to pass a saving throw against STR to avoid **Critical Damage**.

Augmentations have a cost of purchase and installation, as well as periodic maintenance. Installation has a recovery time of 1d6 days. Missing revisions results in malfunctioning implants, forcing a saving throw every 1d6 days until maintenance or removal.

## PSIONICS
Psionics allow control of matter and mind. Only a PC with WIL greater than 12, can be a psionic, if a saving throw against WIL succeeds (WIL/3 talents randomly selected from the Talents Table). Talents cannot be taught or learned, only trained and are inhibited by cybernetic brain implants.

The psion consumes WIL at the indicated cost determing the current level of WIL until recovered. Each excess point decreases STR (**Critical Damage** rules apply).

## COMBAT  
The attacker rolls their weapon die and subtracts the target's Armor, then deals the remaining total to their opponent's HP.

Before calculating damage to HP, subtract the target's **Armor** value from the result of damage rolls. Shields and similar armor provides a bonus defense (e.g. +1 Armor), but only while the item is held or worn.

No one can have more than 3 Armor.

**Unarmed** attacks always do 1d4 damage. If **multiple attackers** target the same foe, roll all damage dice and keep the single highest result. If attacking with **two weapons** at the same time, roll both damage dice and keep the highest.

If an attack is **impaired** , the damage die is reduced to 1d4, regardless of weapon. If the attack is **enhanced**, the attacker rolls 1d12. Attacks with the **blast** quality affect all blast targets, rolling separately for each.

## DAMAGE  
If an attack takes a PC's HP exactly to 0, the player rolls on the [**Scars Table**](#scars-table) table.

Damage that reduces a target's HP **below** 0 decreases their STR by the remainder. They must then make a STR save to avoid **critical damage.**  Failure takes them out of combat, dying if left untreated.

Having STR 0 means **death;** having DEX 0 is paralysis; having WIL 0 is delirium.
