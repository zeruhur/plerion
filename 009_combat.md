# Combat

## Rounds
The game typically plays without strict time accounting. In a fight or circumstance where timing is helpful, use rounds to keep track of when something occurs. A **round** is a short time span (roughly ten seconds of in-game time for characters and ten minutes for starships) and is comprised of turns.

## Distance and Range

For ease of reference, range is relative and noted in three terms: **close**, **nearby**, and **distant**.

|    ---   |  Close  |   Nearby   |   Distant   |
|:--------:|:-------:|:----------:|:-----------:|
|  On foot | < 1.5 m |   < 15 m   |    < 30 m   |
|  Vehicle |  < 50 m |   < 150 m  |   < 500 m   |
| Starship |  Visual | < 5,000 km | < 15,000 km |

## Actions  
On their turn, a character may move up to nearby and take up to one action. This may be using psionics, attacking, making a second move, or some other reasonable action.

Each round, the PCs declare what they are doing before dice are rolled. If a character attempts something risky, the referee calls for a save for appropriate players or NPCs.

## Turns
The referee will telegraph the most likely actions taken by NPCs or creatures. At the start of combat, each PC must make a DEX save to act before their opponents.

> **Example**  
  _Aniet has accidentally stumbled onto the stomping grounds of a massive Black Destroyer. In order to make a move before the Destroyer, she makes a DEX save. She fails, and the Destroyer gets to attack first._

## Attacking & Damage
The attacker rolls their weapon die and subtracts the target's armor, then deals the remaining total to their opponent's HP. Unarmed attacks always do 1d4 damage. If multiple dice are listed in the weapon's damage dice, take the highest result.

> **Example**  
   _The Black Destroyer roars, drawing its claws  and approaching Aniet, who has 5 HP. Claws do 1d6 damage and the referee rolls a 4. They subtract 1 to account for Aniet's light armor, leaving Aniet with 2 HP remaining_.

## Multiple Attackers  
If multiple attackers target the same foe, roll all damage dice and keep the single highest result.

## Attack Modifiers
If fighting from a position of weakness (such as through cover or with bound hands), the attack is **impaired** and the attacker must roll 1d4 damage regardless of the attacks damage die.

If fighting from a position of advantage (such as against a helpless foe or through a daring maneuver), the attack is **enhanced**, allowing the attacker to roll 1d12 damage instead of their normal die.

## Dual Weapons
If attacking with two weapons at the same time, roll both damage dice and keep the single highest result.

## Blast  
Attacks with the **blast** quality affect all targets in the noted blast, rolling separately for each affected character. Blast refers to anything from explosions to huge cleaving onslaughts to the impact of a meteorite. If unsure how many targets can be affected, roll the related damage die for a result.

## Critical Damage
Damage that reduces a target's HP below zero decreases a target's STR by the amount remaining. They must then make a STR save to avoid **critical damage**. Additionally, some enemies will have special abilities or effects that are triggered when their target fails a critical damage save.

Any PC that suffers critical damage cannot do anything but crawl weakly, grasping for life. If given aid and rest, they will stabilize. If left untreated, they die within the hour.

## Ability Score Loss
If a PC's STR is reduced to 0, they die. If their DEX is reduced to 0, they are paralyzed. If their WIL is reduced to 0, they are delirious.
Complete DEX and WIL loss renders the character unable to act until they are restored through extended rest or by extraordinary means.  

## Scars
When damage to a PC reduces their HP to exactly 0, they are sometimes changed irrevocably. See the [**Scars Table**](#scars-table) table for more.

## Unconsciousness & Death
When a character dies, the player is free to create a new character or take control of an Assistant. They immediately join the party in order to reduce downtime.

## Detachments
Large groups of similar combatants fighting together are treated as a single **detachment**. When a detachment takes critical damage, it is routed or significantly weakened. When it reaches 0 STR, it is destroyed.

Attacks against detachments by individuals are **impaired** (excluding blast damage).  
Attacks against individuals by detachments are **enhanced** and deal blast damage.

## Retreat
Running away from a dire situation always requires a successful DEX save, as well as a safe destination to run to.

## Scars Table
When an attack reduces a PC's HP to exactly 0, they are uniquely impacted. Look up the result on the table below based on the total damage taken:

| 3   | Walloped: You’re sent flying and land flat on your face, winded. You are deprived until you rest for a few hours. Then, roll 1d6. Add that amount to your max HP.                                                         |

| 8   | Deafened: You cannot hear anything until you find extraordinary aid. Regardless, make a WIL save. If you pass, increase your max WIL by 1d4.                                                                              |
| 9   | Re-brained: Some hidden part of your psyche is knocked loose. Roll 3d6. If the total is higher than your max WIL, take the new result.                                                                                    |
| 10  | Sundered: An appendage is torn off, crippled or useless. The referee will tell you which. Then, make a WIL save. If you pass, increase your max WIL by 1d6.                                                               |
| 11  | Mortal Wound: You are deprived and out of action. You die in one hour unless healed. Upon recovery, roll 2d6. Take the new result as your max HP.                                                                         |
| 12  | Doomed: Death seemed ever so close, but somehow you survived. If your next save against critical damage is a fail, you die horribly. If you pass, roll 3d6. If the total is higher than your max HP, take the new result. |
